subtitle: Things I'm Listening To
---

Perhaps an unusual thing to have on an academic website, but music is about as important to me as math, so I figured it deserved its own corner of my webpage. I was inspired by s8jfou's website and figured I'd start sharing bits of music I've been enjoying with links to listen or buy. Links will be **[Bandcamp](https://www.bandcamp.com)** when possible. 

If you want to see my semi-complete listening history, you can see it on **[last.fm](https://www.last.fm/user/Redrot)**. It is not quite complete, since I use a variety of platforms to listen to music, but it should contain most scrobs from my desktop and Spotify account. I have also DJed since 2014, playing primarily trance with some techno and ambient, you can hear those mixes on **[Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/sammymmm)**.

## 2025 {#2025}

- [Brendon Moeller - Blue Moon](https://brendonmoellerechologistbeatpharmacy.bandcamp.com/album/blue-moon) (Downtempo). Lovely 90's aesthetic downtempo EP from a producer who has shifted his sound from fairly simplistic lo-fi house to more diverse soundscapes.
- [Stove - Is A Toad In The Rain](https://explodinginsoundrecords.bandcamp.com/album/is-a-toad-in-the-rain) (Indie Rock). I really like the loose, almost mopey feel Stove has.
- [Ovlov - Buds](https://ovlov.bandcamp.com/album/buds-2) (Indie Rock). Nice drive, mix of styles, and ripping sax solo! 

## All-Time Favorites

- [Jon Hopkins - Immunity](https://jonhopkins.bandcamp.com/album/immunity-2) (IDM/Techno). **My favorite album of all time**, every time I listen I hear a new detail I hadn't noticed before. An epic journey through the night or through life or something of the sort.
- [Eco - Wolves](https://blackholerecordings.bandcamp.com/album/wolves) (Progressive Trance). Something about this trance album has always stuck with me.
- [Floating Points - Elaenia](https://floatingpoints.bandcamp.com/album/elaenia) (IDM/Ambient/Jazz). A jazzy ambient, techno-inspired odyssey.
- [18 Carat Affair - Vintage Romance](https://18carataffair.bandcamp.com/album/vintage-romance) (Vaporwave). Nothing quite conveys a feeling of disillusionment and hopelessness like well-executed vaporwave.
- [Nils Frahm - Felt](https://nilsfrahm.bandcamp.com/album/felt) (Contemporary Classical). Very difficult to pick a favorite Nils Frahm album but this is the first one I heard, and maybe his most emotional and textural.
- [The Breathing Effect - Mars Is A Very Bad Place For Love](https://thebreathingeffect.bandcamp.com/album/mars-is-a-very-bad-place-for-love) (Jazz Fusion/Psychedelic Rock). It is!
- [KOAN Sound - Polychrome](https://koansound.bandcamp.com/album/polychrome) (Trip Hop). Funky and introspective trip-hop with some tasty sound design packed up in a lovely journey.
- [Leon Vynehall - Nothing Is Still](https://leonvynehall.bandcamp.com/album/nothing-is-still) (Contemporary). A meditation on immigration from a predominantly house DJ.
- [Boards of Canada - Tomorrow's Harvest](https://boardsofcanada.bandcamp.com/album/tomorrows-harvest) (IDM). Hard to pick a favorite BOC album but this one I think is most relevant in 2025.
- [Skee Mask - Pool](https://iliantape.bandcamp.com/album/itlp09-pool) (Techno/Ambient/IDM). Again hard to pick a favorite Skee Mask album but I'd say Pool slightly edges out Compro. Amazing textures, evocative of a very soft comforting place.
- [Susumu Yokota - The Boy And The Heron](https://susumuyokota.bandcamp.com/album/the-boy-and-the-tree) (Ambient/Psychedelic). Susumu Yokota is in his own right a legend, and it's hard to pick a favorite album since they span so many spheres, but this is in my opinion his boldest, with a clear, expansive vision.
- [Animal Collective - Sung Tongs](https://anmlcollectve.bandcamp.com/album/sung-tongs) (Freak folk/Psychdelic). Not a fan of recent Animal Collective output but this one is memorable and properly messes with you, playful and warped.
- [BT - This Binary Universe](https://songsofbt.bandcamp.com/album/this-binary-universe-remastered) (Ambient/Downtempo). Has a special place in my heart.
- [John Coltrane - A Love Supreme](https://www.discogs.com/master/32287-John-Coltrane-A-Love-Supreme) (Freeish Jazz). Legendary.
- [Alice Coltrane ft. Pharoah Sanders - Journey In Satchidananda](https://www.discogs.com/master/59538-Alice-Coltrane-Featuring-Pharoah-Sanders-Journey-In-Satchidananda) (Spiritual Jazz). Freeing.
- [Matt Lange pres. Altered Tensions - The Answer To The Question You Forgot To Ask](https://www.discogs.com/release/1732748-Altered-Tensions-The-Answer-To-The-Question-You-Forgot-To-Ask) (Glitch). Colorful headtrip, don't know where the Bandcamp page went for this one.
- [Efdemin - New Atlantis](https://ostgut.bandcamp.com/album/new-atlantis) (Techno). A beautiful poem to open and close, and a dark, subnautical, silly journey.
- [Shlohmo - The End](https://shlohmo.bandcamp.com/album/the-end) (LA Beats). An album about the end of the world and chilling, very fitting for our modern era.
- [Flying Lotus - Los Angeles](https://flyinglotus.bandcamp.com/album/los-angeles) (LA Beats). After living in east LA for 5ish years, it's somewhat relatable. RIP Low End Theory.
- [2814 - 新しい日の誕生 (Birth Of A New Day)](https://dreamcatalogue.bandcamp.com/album/--18) (Vaporwave/Ambient). Very popular vaporwave album that hits all the right notes, painting a rich, evocative mental picture of a futuristic city in the still of the night.
- [Kendrick Lamar - To Pimp A Butterfly](https://www.discogs.com/master/810214-Kendrick-Lamar-To-Pimp-A-Butterfly) (Hip-Hop). Hard to pick a favorite K. album but this one is the most ambitious and songs like Alright and u have stuck with me.
- [Atmosphere - Seven's Travels](https://www.discogs.com/master/42085-Atmosphere-Sevens-Travels) (Hip-Hop). In the days of kings and queens I was a jester...
- [dj healer - nothing 2 loose](https://www.discogs.com/release/11849140-DJ-Healer-Nothing-2-Loose) (Ambient/Breaks). Hard to think of an album that makes me feel more at peace.
- [Hania Rani - Esja](https://haniarani.bandcamp.com/album/esja) (Comtemporary Classical). Feels like galloping through the artic plains.
- [djrum - Portrait With Firewood](https://djrum.bandcamp.com/album/portrait-with-firewood) (IDM/Breaks/Techno). Lovely concept album interweaving wicked breaks with gorgeous piano and atmosphere.
- [Rob Clouth - Zero Point](https://robclouth.bandcamp.com/album/zero-point) (Glitch/IDM). Chaotic and tunneling.
- [Clark - Body Riddle](https://clark.bandcamp.com/album/body-riddle-remastered) (Glitch/IDM). Almost childlike, in a way it reminds me of the Dream Parade from Paprika in its color and momentum.
- [Earl Sweatshirt - I Don't Like S***, I Don't Go Outside](https://www.discogs.com/master/821355-Earl-Sweatshirt-I-Dont-Like-Shit-I-Dont-Go-Outside-An-Album-By-Earl-Sweatshirt) (Hip-Hop). I love all of Earl's phases but his dark, depression rap resonates with me differently.
- [Donato Dozzy - K](https://www.discogs.com/release/2493983-Donato-Dozzy-K) (Dub Techno). Very hopeful dub techno album.
- [Porter Ricks - Biokinetics](https://forceincmilleplateaux.bandcamp.com/album/biokinetics) (Dub Techno). Honestly it's mostly the first track that I love but what a track it is. Amazing how a loop that goes on for 12 minutes can have so much depth and detail.
- [Culprate - Deliverance](https://culprate.bandcamp.com/album/deliverance) (Trip Hop). Very playful and psychedelic.
- [Kikagaku Moyo - House In The Tall Grass](https://kikagakumoyoggb.bandcamp.com/album/house-in-the-tall-grass) (Psychedelic Rock). Speaking of playful, this album makes me want to get up and not really dance but at least clap my hands in a funny way.
- [Dream Theater - Octavarium](https://dreamtheater.net/discography/octavarium/) (Progressive Metal). When I was little I was very into metal, and while most of that has faded away in time (as I've become generally a much less angry, bitter person), a few albums that paint a more complex picture as far as metal go stick with me. The ending opus is a full life's journey in 20 minutes.
