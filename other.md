## Outdoors {#outdoors}

I love canoeing, backpacking, snowboarding,  and climbing, and I even spent a few summers leading canoeing trips in the BWCA in Minnesota during my undergraduate years. The wilderness holds a special place in my heart. Some of my most formative experiences as an adolescent were long canoeing trips, and whenever I return to nature for a visit, I find an emotional peace and tranquility that I don't think exists elsewhere in the modern world. The wild encourages us to be alone with ourselves, to dig deep within and discover parts of us we'd never known. I hope that future generations will have these same experiences. However, this may not happen unless humans relearn to care for and respect the lands they borrow.

## Other interests 

I am an avid reader of [The Sun Magazine](https://www.thesunmagazine.org/) (no, not the tabloid), [Hi Fructose](https://hifructose.com/) (no, not the corn syrup), [Aeon](https://aeon.co/) (no, not the length of time), and [Nautilus](https://nautil.us/) (no, not the mollusk). I occasionally contribute nonsense to the journal of microdadaism [dadakuku](https://dadakuku.com).

Other random hobbies include chess, video games (predominantly indie games and RTSs), origami, slacklining, longboarding, [freeskating](https://www.jmkride.com/), reading, calisthenics, drawing, backgammon, puzzles, and penguins. Feel free to chat about any of these if we meet in the wild!
