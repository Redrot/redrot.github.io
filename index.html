I am a Mathematics Ph.D. student at UC Santa Cruz, currently studying Modular Representation Theory under the supervision of Robert Boltje. Prior to beginning my Ph.D., I worked as a software engineer at SupplyFrame. I completed my undergraduate degree in mathematics with a minor in political studies at Harvey Mudd College in 2017.

Beyond research, I have a strong interest in mathematics education and outreach, specifically concerning equity, inclusivity, and social justice within mathematics and other STEM fields. I strongly believe there are many institutional, cultural, and socioeconomic barriers which restrict participation and prevent diversity in mathematics. My current focus is implementing inclusive and equitable teaching practices in the classroom, and engaging in mathematical outreach for underrepresented groups.
