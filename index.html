<h1> About Me </h1>

I am a Mathematics Ph.D. student at UC Santa Cruz, currently studying Modular Representation Theory under the supervision of Robert Boltje. Prior to beginning my Ph.D., I worked as a software engineer at SupplyFrame. I completed my undergraduate degree in Mathematics at Harvey Mudd College in 2017.

<br>
Outside of mathematics, I have a wide range of interests and hobbies. These include:
<br>
<ul>
  <li> Music: I play rock guitar, jazz saxophone, and mix trance and techno music. In addition, I spend way too much time digging for and listening to music.</li>
  <li> Camping: I backpack and canoe. In the summer of 2013, I spent 6 weeks canoeing down the Kazan river in the Arctic Circle! I spent the two summers after that leading canoeing trips for middle- and high-schoolers.</li>
  <li> Fitness & Sports: I primarily climb, boulder, snowboard, and do calisthenics. During my undergrad, I powerlifted, and in high school, I played baseball. </li>
  <li> Games: I play both tabletop games, like Chess and Backgammon, and video games, like Starcraft. </li>
</ul>
