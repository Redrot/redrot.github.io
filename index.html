<b>I am also on the postdoc market for the 2024-2025 academic year!</b>
<br>
I have been awarded a UC Santa Cruz Dissertation Year Fellowship for the 2024-2025 academic year! This allows me to travel much more easily. If you are interested in working with me or want me to give a talk, please reach out! 
<br>
<br>
I am a mathematics Ph.D. candidate at the University of California Santa Cruz. I study the modular representation theory of finite groups under the supervision of <a href="https://boltje.math.ucsc.edu/">Robert Boltje</a>. See my <a href="https://redrot.github.io/research/">research page</a> for more details.
<br>
<br>
Prior to beginning my Ph.D., I was a platform engineer at <a href="https://supplyframe.com/">SupplyFrame</a>, using computer vision and natural language processing to optimize their services. I completed my undergraduate degree at <a href="https://www.hmc.edu/mathematics/">Harvey Mudd College</a> in 2017 (WIBSTR), with a major in Mathematics and a concentration in Political Studies, focusing on environmental and ethnic politics. 
<br> 
<br>
Beyond research, I am strongly interested in mathematics education and outreach, specifically concerning equity and inclusivity within mathematics and other STEM fields.
