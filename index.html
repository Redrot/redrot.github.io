I am a <b>Limited Term Assistant Professor</b> (i.e. a postdoc) at the <b><a href="https://www.math.uga.edu/">University of Georgia</a></b>, studying representation theory and tensor-triangular geometry with <b><a href="https://www.nateharman.com/">Nate Harman</a></b> and <b><a href="https://www.math.uga.edu/directory/people/daniel-k-nakano">Dan Nakano</a></b>. For more on my research, visit my <b><a href="https://redrot.github.io/research/">research page</a></b>.

I completed my Ph.D. in 2025 at the <b><a href="https://www.math.ucsc.edu/">University of California Santa Cruz</a></b> under the supervision of <b><a href="https://boltje.math.ucsc.edu/">Robert Boltje</a></b>. Prior to beginning my Ph.D., I was a platform engineer at <b><a href="https://supplyframe.com/">SupplyFrame</a></b> who dabbled in NLP and AI. I completed my undergraduate at <b><a href="https://www.hmc.edu/mathematics/">Harvey Mudd College</a></b> in 2017 <b><a href="https://wibstr.org/">(WIBSTR)</a></b> with a major in mathematics, advised by <b><a href="https://www.arthurbenjamin.info/">Art Benjamin</a></b>, with a concentration in political studies focusing on environmental and ethnic politics.
