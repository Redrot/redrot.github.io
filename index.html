I am a Mathematics Ph.D. student at UC Santa Cruz, currently studying Modular Representation Theory under the supervision of Robert Boltje. Prior to beginning my Ph.D., I worked as a software engineer at SupplyFrame. I completed my undergraduate degree in mathematics with a minor in political studies at Harvey Mudd College in 2017.

Beyond research, I have a strong interest in mathematics education and outreach, specifically concerning equity, inclusivity, and social justice within mathematics and other STEM fields. I strongly believe there are many institutional, cultural, and socioeconomic barriers which restrict participation and prevent diversity in mathematics. My current focus is implementing inclusive and equitable teaching practices in the classroom, and engaging in mathematical outreach for underrepresented groups.

Outside of mathematics, I have a wide range of interests and hobbies. These include:
<br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li> Music: I play rock guitar, jazz saxophone, and mix trance and techno music. In addition, I spend way too much time digging for and listening to music.</li>
  <li> Camping: I backpack and canoe. In the summer of 2013, I spent 6 weeks canoeing down the Kazan river in the Arctic Circle! I spent the two summers after that leading canoeing trips for middle- and high-schoolers.</li>
  <li> ports: I primarily climb, boulder, snowboard, and do calisthenics. During my undergrad, I powerlifted, and in high school, I played baseball. </li>
  <li> Games: I play both tabletop games, like Chess and Backgammon, and video games, like Starcraft. </li>
</ul>
