I am a <b>Limited Term Assistant Professor</b> (i.e. a postdoc) at the <b><a href="https://www.math.uga.edu/">University of Georgia</a></b>, studying representation theory and tensor-triangular geometry with <b><a href="https://www.nateharman.com/">Nate Harman</a></b> and <b><a href="https://www.math.uga.edu/directory/people/daniel-k-nakano">Dan Nakano</a></b>. Additionally, I am funded by an <b><a href="https://www.ams.org/grants-awards/travel-grants/AMS-SimonsTG">AMS-Simons Travel Grant</a></b>.
