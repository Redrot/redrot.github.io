<br>
I am a mathematics Ph.D. candidate at the University of California Santa Cruz. I study modular representation theory under the supervision of <b><a href="https://boltje.math.ucsc.edu/">Robert Boltje</a></b>. See my <b><a href="https://redrot.github.io/research/">research page</a></b> for more details.
<br>
<br>
Prior to beginning my Ph.D., I was a platform engineer at <b><a href="https://supplyframe.com/">SupplyFrame</a></b>, using computer vision and natural language processing to optimize their services. I completed my undergraduate degree at <b><a href="https://www.hmc.edu/mathematics/">Harvey Mudd College</a></b> in 2017 (WIBSTR), with a major in Mathematics and a concentration in Political Studies, focusing on environmental and ethnic politics. 
<br> 
<br>
Beyond research, I am strongly interested in mathematics education and outreach. Here are my <b><a href="https://redrot.github.io/assets/pdf/CV_2_13_25.pdf">CV</a></b>, <b><a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=y5UmIBgAAAAJ">Google Scholar</a></b> page, <b><a href="https://arxiv.org/search/math?query=Miller%2C+Sam+K&searchtype=author&abstracts=show&order=-announced_date_first&size=50">arXiv</a></b>, and <b><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sam-Miller-55">ResearchGate</a></b>.
