I am a Mathematics Ph.D. candidate at the University of California, Santa Cruz. I am interested in the modular representation theory of finite groups and research under the supervision of <a href="https://boltje.math.ucsc.edu/">Robert Boltje</a>. Prior to beginning my Ph.D., I was a platform engineer at <a href="https://supplyframe.com/">SupplyFrame</a>, using computer vision and natural language processing to optimize their services. I completed my undergraduate degree at <a href="https://www.hmc.edu/mathematics/">Harvey Mudd College</a> in 2017 (WIBSTR), with a major in Mathematics and a concentration in Political Studies, focusing on environmental and ethnic politics. 
<br> 
<br>
Beyond research, I have a strong interest in mathematics education and outreach, specifically concerning equity and inclusivity within mathematics and other STEM fields. I strongly believe there are many institutional, cultural, and socioeconomic barriers that restrict participation and impede diversity in mathematics, and to combat this, I focus on implementing inclusive and equitable teaching practices in the classroom.
