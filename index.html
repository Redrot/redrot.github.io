<h1> About Me </h1>

I am a Mathematics Ph.D. student at UC Santa Cruz, currently studying Modular Representation Theory under the supervision of Robert Boltje. Prior to beginning my Ph.D., I worked as a software engineer at SupplyFrame. I completed my undergraduate degree in Mathematics at Harvey Mudd College in 2017.
