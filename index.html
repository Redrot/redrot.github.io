I am a Mathematics Ph.D. candidate at the University of California, Santa Cruz, currently studying Modular Representation Theory under the supervision of <a href="https://boltje.math.ucsc.edu/">Robert Boltje</a>. Prior to beginning my Ph.D., I worked as a software engineer at <a href="https://supplyframe.com/">SupplyFrame</a>, using computer vision and natural language processing to optimize their services. I completed my undergraduate degree at <a href="https://www.hmc.edu/mathematics/">Harvey Mudd College</a> in 2017 (WIBSTR!!), with a major in Mathematics and a concentration in Political Studies, focusing on environmental and ethnic politics.

<br>
Beyond research, I have a strong interest in mathematics education and outreach, specifically concerning equity, inclusivity, and social justice within mathematics and other STEM fields. I strongly believe there are many institutional, cultural, and socioeconomic barriers which restrict participation and impede diversity in mathematics, and I focus on implementing inclusive and equitable teaching practices in the classroom.
