## Expository Writing & Notes {#writing}

- ["Notes on Tensor Induction of Chain Complexes"](https://redrot.github.io/assets/pdf/Partial_Tensor_Induction_on_Chain_Complexes.pdf)
> Partial notes from a paper that is currently on hold. This is a description of tensor induction of chain complexes, first discovered by Leonard Evens, as well as a few elementary properties that, to our knowledge, have never been written down with proof. 
- ["Finding Joy With Combinatorial Games"](https://redrot.github.io/assets/pdf/Combinatorial_Games_Talk_2_25.pdf)
> Notes I prepared for a talk on combinatorial games. Topics presented are from undergraduate research or communicated from a seminar course from Arthur Benjamin.
