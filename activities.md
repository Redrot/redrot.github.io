## Expository Writing & Notes {#writing}

### Notes from Research
- ["*A Splendid Rickard Complex For* $\mathcal{O}C_2$ *And* $\mathcal{O}C_2$ *Arising From* $B(C_2)^\times$"](https://redrot.github.io/assets/pdf/C_2_Rickard_Complex_Computation.pdf)
  - The first example I worked out for my thesis work in 2021. The methods used here are outdated and the proofs can be done much more efficiently, but it's interesting to go back and see how I initially went about trying to work things out!

### Notes from Readings
- [Bouc 2.3, Bisets](https://redrot.github.io/assets/pdf/biset_notes.pdf)
- [Linkelmann 1.2, Group Cohomology](https://redrot.github.io/assets/pdf/1_2_group_cohomology_notes.pdf)
- [Linkelmann 1.4, Category Algebras](https://redrot.github.io/assets/pdf/1_4_Category_Algebra_notes.pdf)
