Hello! Welcome to my website. I've been putting off finishing this thing forever - it feels good to (mostly) get it up and running! 

This page is meant to serve as my academic website, but with a few more personal touches. I plan on blogging intermittently about what I'm doing mathematically, my target audience for the time being those who are mathematically interested, but not particularly advanced. Let's say either current undergraduate math majors or college graduates with non-math degrees. My first goal is to write a series of posts explaining my dissertation problem and program, assuming only a base understanding of group or ring theory. We'll see where we go from there - hopefully a few people online find it interesting!
