I am primarily interested in the modular representation theory of finite groups. This means that I study vector spaces (over finite fields, such as the field $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$) with additional symmetry described by a finite group. In this setting, there is an underlying "local-to-global" philosophy, which states that the representation theory of a finite group $G$ should be related to the representation theory of its " $p$ -local" subgroups. I seek to discover and understand these connections on a structural level by working with categories, and their geometry, which appear to govern this philosophy. 

**Current focuses**

- Noncommutative tensor-triangular geometry
- Intersections of modular representation theory and tensor-triangulated geometry
- Invertible objects, such as endotrivial complexes
- Permutation modules and oligomorphic groups
- Biset functors (i.e. global Mackey functors) and applications
- Galois descent in representation theory
- Local-to-global conjectures such as Broue's abelian defect group conjecture
- Categorification

## Current projects {#inp}

- **The Euler characteristic of an endotrivial complex** (in preparation)
> (w/ [Nadia Mazza](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/maths/people/nadia-mazza))     
> We further study the image of the group of endotrivial complexes, i.e. the Picard group of the bounded homotopy category of $p$-permutation modules, in the corresponding Grothendieck group, i.e. the trivial source ring. 
- **Twistier cohomology** (in preparation) and **Permutation modules and Borel-Smith conditions**
> We generalize the twisted cohomology ring constructed in Balmer, Gallauer, *The geometry of permutation modules* that uses the classification of endotrivial complexes. This gives a construction for which the "comparison map" is injective for any finite $p$-group. Some of these techniques hopefully generalize to abstract settings under certain compatibility conditions.     
> We also look for ways the Borel-Smith conditions manifest themselves in the ttg of permutation modules by computing Picard groups of localizations. 
- **The noncommutative tensor-triangular geometry of a block algebra**
> We determine aspects of the noncommutative ttg of categories of (permutation) block bimodules, following Nakano, Vashaw, Yakimov. These computations could have immediate implications for the abelian defect group conjecture since a splendid Rickard equivalence induces a monoidal triangulated equivalence between the corresponding bimodule categories.
- **A Rickard theorem for splendid Rickard equivalences**
> We (attempt to) show that an equivalence of bounded homotopy categories of $p$-permutation (bi)modules implies the existence of a splendid Rickard equivalence, a $p$-permutation analogue of Rickard's theorem. 
- **The classification of endotrivial complexes over arbitrary noetherian rings**
> (w/ Juan Omar Gomez)    
> We determine the Picard group of $K^b(p-\text{perm}(kG))$ over arbitrary noetherian rings $k$ (in particular, $\mathbb{Z}$ ) using recent work of Gomez. Grodal and Krause have considered the analogous question for endotrivial modules.
