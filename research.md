My research focus lies within the modular representation theory of finite groups, in particular the block theory of finite group algebras. I also have a strong interest in the theory of biset functors developed by Bouc, an extension of Mackey functors. My dissertation question involves determining when a $p$-permutation equivalence, an isomorphism of Grothendieck groups induced by virtual $p$-permutation bimodules, lifts to a splendid equivalence, an equivalence of derived categories first introduced by Rickard. These equivalences are further connected to isotypies, a "bouquet" of perfect isometries first studied by Broué. Broué's celebrated *abelian defect group conjecture* predicts the existence of these equivalences, and though it has been verified in many cases, the conjecture still appears to be out of reach with our current understanding. 

My undergraduate interests were primarily combinatorics-focused. In particular, my research projects involved studying combinatorial puzzles. Though this is far removed from my current focus, my future hope is to find intersectional questions and to find more combinatorial questions within modular representation theory.
