I am primarily interested in the modular representation theory of finite groups. 

**Current focuses**
- Local-to-global conjectures such as Broue's abelian defect group conjecture
- Invertible objects such as endotrivial modules and complexes
- Intersections of modular representation theory and tensor-triangulated geometry
- Biset functors (i.e. global Mackey functors) and applications
- Galois descent in representation theory
- Categorification
