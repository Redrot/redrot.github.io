I am primarily interested in the modular representation theory of finite groups. This means that I study vector spaces (over finite fields, such as the field $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$) with additional symmetry described by a finite group. In this setting, there is an underlying "local-to-global" philosophy, which states that the representation theory of a finite group $G$ should be related to the representation theory of its " $p$ -local" subgroups. I seek to discover and understand these connections on a structural level by working with categories, and their geometry, which appear to govern this philosophy. 

**Current focuses**

- Noncommutative tensor-triangular geometry
- Intersections of modular representation theory and tensor-triangulated geometry
- Invertible objects such as endotrivial complexes
- Permutation modules and oligomorphic groups
- Galois descent in representation theory
- Broue's abelian defect group conjecture and local-to-global representation theory of finite groups
- Biset functors and applications

## In preparation {#inp}

- **The Euler characteristic of an endotrivial complex** (in preparation)
> (w/ [Nadia Mazza](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/maths/people/nadia-mazza))     
> We further study the image of the group of endotrivial complexes, i.e. the Picard group of the bounded homotopy category of $p$-permutation modules, in the corresponding Grothendieck group, i.e. the trivial source ring. 
- **Twistier cohomology** (in preparation) 
> We generalize the twisted cohomology ring constructed in Balmer, Gallauer, *The geometry of permutation modules* that uses the classification of endotrivial complexes. This gives a construction for which the "comparison map" is an embedding for any finite $p$-group. Some of these techniques hopefully generalize to abstract settings under certain compatibility conditions.
