I am primarily interested in the modular representation theory of finite groups. This means that I study vector spaces (over finite fields, such as the field $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$) with additional symmetry described by a finite group. In this setting, there is an underlying "local-to-global" philosophy, which states that the representation theory of a finite group $G$ should be related to the representation theory of its " $p$ -local" subgroups. I seek to discover and understand these connections on a structural level by working with categories, and their geometry, which appear to govern this philosophy. 

**Current focuses**
- Local-to-global conjectures such as Broue's abelian defect group conjecture
- Invertible objects such as endotrivial modules and complexes
- Intersections of modular representation theory and tensor-triangulated geometry
- Biset functors (i.e. global Mackey functors) and applications
- Galois descent in representation theory
- Categorification
