I study the modular representation theory of finite groups. Here are some topics I am presently interested in or plan to study in the future:

**Current focuses**
- Local-to-global conjectures such as Broue's abelian defect group conjecture.
- Invertible objects such as endotrivial modules and complexes.
- Biset functors and applications.

**Future interests**
- Intersections of modular representation theory and tensor-triangulated geometry.
- Categorification and diagrammatic categories.
- Intersections of combinatorics and modular representation theory.
- Counting conjectures such as Alperin's weight conjecture.
